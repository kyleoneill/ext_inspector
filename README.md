# Ext Inspector

This is a command line app which recursively searches a directory for files that have a mismatch between their [magic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number) and their extension.

This mismatch is typically present when somebody is trying to disguise or hide a file. This app is currently just a learning experiment and not intended to be used in an actual search.
